# ChatFlow – Architecture Design

## 1. Overview
ChatFlow is a real-time messaging platform built for scalability, security, and low-latency communication. The system separates HTTP APIs and WebSocket services to handle user interactions efficiently and scale independently.

---

## 2. Tech Stack
**Frontend:** Next.js (App Router) + React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS  
**Backend:** Node.js (Next.js API Routes + Express) + Socket.IO  
**Database:** PostgreSQL (via Supabase)  
**Cache & Pub/Sub:** Redis  
**Storage:** AWS S3 (for attachments)  
**Search:** Elasticsearch (for message search)  
**Background Jobs:** BullMQ (Redis-based queues)  
**Authentication:** Supabase Auth (JWT-based)  
**Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend/API), Render/EC2 (Realtime + Workers)

---

## 3. Data Flow
1. Users send requests via HTTPS or WebSocket connections.  
2. Load Balancer routes HTTP to API servers and WS traffic to Realtime servers.  
3. API servers handle CRUD operations, persist to PostgreSQL, and cache in Redis.  
4. Realtime servers use Redis Pub/Sub to broadcast updates (messages, typing, reactions).  
5. Workers handle background jobs (uploads, indexing, notifications).  
6. Admins moderate via privileged APIs and analytics endpoints.

## 4. Database Schema 

**users**  
- id (PK), username, email, role, password_hash, created_at  

**channels**  
- id (PK), name, is_private, created_by  

**messages**  
- id (PK), channel_id (FK), user_id (FK), content, attachment_url, created_at  
- index(channel_id, created_at)

**reactions**  
- id (PK), message_id (FK), user_id (FK), emoji  

**channel_members**  
- id (PK), channel_id (FK), user_id (FK), role  

**notifications**  
- id (PK), user_id (FK), type, message, read_at  

---

## 5. Scalability Plan
- Horizontal scaling for API, Realtime, and Worker services.  
- Read replicas and partitioned tables in PostgreSQL for high-volume message storage.  
- Redis for distributed caching and real-time message delivery.  
- CDN for static assets and global availability.  
- Separate microservices for Search, Notifications, and Moderation.

---

## 6. Performance Optimization
- WebSocket connection reuse and message batching for low latency.  
- Message queues ensure non-blocking tasks.  
- Caching recent messages and channels in Redis.  
- Pagination and lazy loading for large message histories.  
- Connection fallback hierarchy: WS → SSE → HTTP Polling.

---

## 7. Security Considerations
- HTTPS/WSS enforced.  
- JWT authentication and role-based access (Admin, Moderator, User).  
- Rate limiting on message sends.  
- Content filtering for uploads and text moderation.  
- Encrypted file storage and secure environment variables.
